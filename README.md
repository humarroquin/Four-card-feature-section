## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: [4cdfsnov23.netlify.app](https://4cdfsnov23.netlify.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I continued practicing with CSS Grid, applying the span and order properties.

### Continued development

It took some research and testing to move the images to the right place. I'll continue doing research on the following: inline, inline-block, and block elements.

Also, I think the code for the top borders is repeated, not following the DRY principle. I will do further research on how to reduce this.
